Locker command

Some extra Info about the .locker command

You can't store wonder weapons/equipment in the locker.
On some servers like H2G you can buy more than one locker slots with this .buylocker command

Price of slots increase with each slot you buy

Every slot has a number which you can use to switch between them, first/default locker is locker 0 and the first locker you purchase will be locker 1 and so on

You can only use one slot at a time and if you want to store another weapon in the locker you will have to buy a slot first and then type .locker 1 it'll select the second locker and than you can store your weapon in it and use it later.
If you've multiple locker slots than just type .locker and then the number of the slot you want to use like 3,5 or 9. Example: .locker 3 .locker 5 .locker 9

Another thing to keep in mind is that lockers don't work on different servers, whatever you store in H2G servers can only be used in H2G and no other server
